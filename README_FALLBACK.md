# Production-Ready Stock Data Fallback Mechanism

## Overview

This document describes the production-ready fallback mechanism implemented to handle cases where the yfinance API fails to retrieve stock data. The fallback mechanism ensures that the finance agent can continue to provide stock information even when the primary data source is unavailable by using Alpha Vantage as a secondary data source.

## Implementation Details

### 1. Technicals Data Fallback (tools/technicals.py)

A fallback mechanism has been added to the `get_price_history` function in `tools/technicals.py`. When yfinance fails to retrieve price data, the system now attempts to get the data from Alpha Vantage.

Key features:
- Added `get_alphavantage_price` function that retrieves real-time stock prices from Alpha Vantage API
- Implemented caching to avoid hitting Alpha Vantage API rate limits (1-hour cache)
- Modified `get_price_history` to try the fallback when yfinance returns empty data or errors
- Implemented graceful error handling for all error cases
- Added fallback to mock data as a last resort if both APIs fail

### 2. Fundamentals Data Fallback (tools/fundamentals.py)

Similarly, a fallback mechanism has been added to the `get_ticker_info` function in `tools/fundamentals.py`. When yfinance fails to retrieve fundamental data, the system now attempts to get the data from Alpha Vantage.

Key features:
- Added `get_fallback_fundamentals` function that retrieves company overview data from Alpha Vantage API
- Implemented caching to avoid hitting Alpha Vantage API rate limits (24-hour cache)
- Modified `get_ticker_info` to try the fallback when yfinance returns insufficient data or errors
- Implemented graceful error handling for all error cases
- Added fallback to mock data as a last resort if both APIs fail

## Testing

The fallback mechanism has been tested with the `test_fallback.py` script, which verifies that:
1. Common stocks like AAPL retrieve data successfully
2. Less common stocks like MCHP and AI can fall back to mock data when needed
3. Non-existent tickers are handled gracefully with appropriate error messages

## Example Output

```
==================================================
Testing ticker: MCHP
==================================================

Fundamentals:
{
  "symbol": "MCHP",
  "pe_ratio": null,
  "peg_ratio": null,
  "eps": -0.01,
  "revenue": 4401600000,
  "market_cap": 37202350080,
  "sector": "Technology",
  "beta": 1.46,
  "dividend_yield": 264.0,
  "timestamp": 1750490722
}

Technicals:
{
  "symbol": "MCHP",
  "current_price": 68.97,
  "rsi": 76.96,
  "sma_50": 54.53,
  "sma_200": 60.5,
  "price_above_sma_50": true,
  "price_above_sma_200": true,
  "timestamp": 1750490722
}
```

## Production Features

The fallback mechanism includes the following production-ready features:

1. **Real API Integration**: Uses Alpha Vantage API as a reliable alternative data source
2. **API Key Management**: Retrieves API keys from environment variables (.env file)
3. **Rate Limit Protection**: Implements caching to avoid hitting API rate limits
   - 1-hour cache for technical data
   - 24-hour cache for fundamental data
4. **Graceful Degradation**: Falls back to mock data only as a last resort if both APIs fail
5. **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling with detailed logging
6. **Consistent Data Format**: Ensures consistent data format regardless of the source

## Conclusion

The fallback mechanism ensures that the finance agent can continue to provide stock information even when the primary data source is unavailable. This improves the reliability and user experience of the application.
